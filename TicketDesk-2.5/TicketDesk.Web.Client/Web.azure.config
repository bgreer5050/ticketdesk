    <!-- 
      For Azure search you can either define a connection string in 
      web.config, or (preferably) setup a connection string through the 
      Azure portal in your site's settings. 
      
      Alternately, you can use two keys in appSettings instead of a 
      connection string. Again, it would be better to define the appSettings
      through the Azure portal in your site's settings. 
      
      The appSettings is best if you plan to use the reddog-search-portal 
      web site extensions, since the extensions can only use the appSettings 
      anyway. The advantage to connection strings is that the security is 
      better and the strings can be encrypted if you prefer.
      
      Here is the format for the connection string:
      
      <add name="AzureSearch"  connectionString="ServiceName=[name of you azure search service];ApiKey=[you api key]" xdt:Locator="name" xdt:Transform="insert"/>
      
      Example: 
      
      <add name="AzureSearch" connectionString="ServiceName=mysearchservice;ApiKey=4B564C046ACC69901A91E474F85D8A8A" />
    -->
  </connectionStrings>
  <appSettings>
    <!--
      For Azure Search, you can define connection info here, or as a connectin string (see connection strings for more details)
    
      <add key="Azure.Search.ServiceName" value="mysearchservice" xdt:Locator="name" xdt:Transform="insert" />
      <add key="Azure.Search.ApiKey" value="4B564C046ACC69901A91E474F85D8A8A" xdt:Locator="name" xdt:Transform="insert"/>
    -->
  </appSettings>
