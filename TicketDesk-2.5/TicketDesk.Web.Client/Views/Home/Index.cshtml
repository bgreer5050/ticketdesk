        <h2>Welcome to TicketDesk 2.5</h2>
        <p>
            Currently this is just an alpha build.
        </p>
        <p class="alert-danger">
            Do not use this to upgrade a production TD 2.1 system.
            You will NOT like the results...
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm in the process of porting in the new UI bits, and am refactoring the back-end as I go.
            The ticket center is largely complete, though performance tweaks and back-end settings are still in progress.
            There are some very interesting changes in how list settings are managed, as well as in how ESQL queries are being generated to drive the ticket center.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basic search services have been re-designed. Currently TD 2.5 will auto-detect if you
            are running in Azure. When in Azure, it will use Azure Search services. This requires
            an Azure search connection string, or two appSettings keys. See the comments in
            web.azure.config for more information. If not running in Azure, it will default to
            Lucene.net search with indexes stored on the local web server's file system (similar to
            how TD 2.1 search worked).
        </p>
        <p>
            The admin settings will eventually be expanded to give full control over how search
            behaves. For now, you can perform some crude @Html.ActionLink("index management here", "Index", "SearchManager", new { area = "admin" }, null)
        </p>
        <div class="well well-sm">
            @if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("WEBSITE_SITE_NAME")))
            {
                <h3>Congratulations! You appear to be running in Azure.</h3>
            }
            <h3>Logins:</h3>
            <p>
                Login with one of the following:
                <ul>admin@example.com</ul>
                <ul>staff@example.com</ul>
                <ul>user@example.com</ul>
                Password is "123456" for all three users.
            </p>
