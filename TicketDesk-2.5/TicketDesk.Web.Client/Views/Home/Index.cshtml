        <h2>Welcome to TicketDesk 2.5</h2>
        <p>
            Currently this is just an alpha build.
        </p>
        <p class="alert-danger">
            Legacy DB Upgrades are supported. Feel free to test this, but please do not upgrade your production TD 2.1 database. 
        </p>
        <p>I'm in the process of porting in the new UI bits, and am refactoring the back-end as I go.
            The ticket center is largely complete. I'm working on ticket creation and editing next.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basic search services have been re-designed. Currently TD 2.5 will auto-detect if you
            are running in Azure. See the comments in web.azure.config for more information. If not running in Azure, it fallback to 
            Lucene.net (same as TD 2.1).
        </p>
        <p>
            The admin settings will eventually be expanded to give full control over how search
            behaves. For now, you can perform some crude @Html.ActionLink("index management here", "Index", "SearchManager", new { area = "admin" }, null)
        </p>
        <div class="well well-sm">
            @if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("WEBSITE_SITE_NAME")))
            {
                <h3>Congratulations! You appear to be running in Azure.</h3>
            }
            <h3>Logins:</h3>
            <p>
                Login with one of the following:
                <ul>admin@example.com</ul>
                <ul>staff@example.com</ul>
                <ul>user@example.com</ul>
                Password is "123456" for all three users.
            </p>
            @*@Html.ActionLink("Create Search Index", "Indexer");*@
